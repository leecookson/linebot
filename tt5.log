Last time I was in one of these XW chats we were all discussing how a series should be scored. Almost all of us seemed to agree that AHW trophies should not count towards AXW placement. Have we heard anything from Gaea/Christian regarding this? If not, is there anything we can do to get there attention?
Visit christian at work. Lol
Awful quiet in here...you guys must actually be able to play in your worlds...
Had to ruin it
Yes a lot to catch up in the game
Lol nope nothing really to do in game
I did few things bored now lmao
Give it few days of being in here tree, you wont think it quiet lol
Do they still review the forums?
Did they ever?
Dont think so i havent seen anyone from gaea on there for ages
Only time is wen christian posts results really
So there is no way we can influence them?
Dont think so lol
We can only hope they/Christian reads in here occasionally
And that it's when the chat is productive rather than petty squabbles
So spam the fuck out of Christian via pm?
He doesn't respond to pm
Dont blame him he prob gets to many lol
I can't think of any argument against scoring axw by axw and ixw trophies
Maybe axw by pure axw trophies
But including HW makes it somewhat not xw anymore
Yeps
group message
It's the same reason xw TK and xw shard are disliked. HW results and politics doesn't tell you how good an alliance is xw
This Christian? Spam via LinkedIn? Lol
This isn't the place to plan your stalking of gaea employees
That's not cool. üòï
Agree axiom
No thats not cool
Well, I for one think it's pretty cool.  He obviously put it out there himself
Its a year old
My bad. I saw the help wanted thing and thought it was funny. Didn't pay attention to the date.
Hopefully they put another ad out soon. The man could probably use some help.

I would take up to 2 maintenance every week and compensated
now if only we got prize/event payouts as quick, that'd be awesome
Just logged in.. no mith
I got mine it pops up
I logged in and got mine
Did not pop up after 3 refreshes

Numbers description is normal
It's like that on all of them I think Cerid
It was for me ... Doesn't matter, you get the mith
True üòä That's for Italian world - was it the same on English ?
Yeah for 300 mith they could call it poop on a stick I'll still click it
Yes Cerid.
My server is English. It was like that on every one I logged into.
Lol John ;)
Click the blue button
Today is a good payday, free 310 mith
Thanks üòä It's a one-off so possibly they did not have time to get it translated
Do you guys take the time to review CS performance ?
group message
This is what I mean
I am very pleased for 3 Gollum hour glasses. Best CS ever
Hi do we receive 300 mithril on each world or is it randomly ?
Each
no mith on 169
Log off and log back on, George
my members are seeing it on other servers but not 169
thanks I will keep try
People on 176 aren't getting either
No mith 174 ir 175
i refreshed and closed and reopened
Make sure they are logging off and back on
Maybe they are going sequential
173 got it
oh no...not 173
I got it on 126, 151, 152, 168 and 263...so ... Give it time
yes ma'am ;)
They might missed some world,  need ping FS
Big numbered and small numbered worlds all getting them, and payout started 40 mins ago.  Does not think it is timing
Got mith on 245 and 252
5min before calendar date changed to 7th lol
236 got the mith but can't do much else in game--claim login, train, send march, anything really...but no worries we can still buy mith and play the archery ;)
Can't even chat in ac.
Or gc
171 has not seen it yet fyi.  Refreshed as well
6 hours of sleep 15 hours work, at least 2k messages what i miss? Summary lol, ill read them all eventually
System down, system up, 300 mith compensation but not everyone has gotten it
One world still dead
I got it just now, i see they added enchanters and bowmen to stats on gear, anything else
2 worlds still dead
Only leg V gets the extra tacts
I got to gaea being like homer simpson working in the nuclear plant had to laugh
The drinking game sounds good i probably misses 500 shots :)
Lol
I got u covered
Picked up the slack
Lmao
Merges
Demounts
Yes 144 still down ...I did get to claim the mith tho
Lots of players saying they didn't get the mith comp on severs 174, 175, 176 , can fs ask gaea to look into this
And 169 to that list
You had to login or refresh after 0:00 utc on the 7th to get the mith.  Mine showed an item.desc and the button had popup button on it but the mith went to the right place.
That was just 2 hours ago
Congrats... most servers got it just not all
That is strange.
Agreed. 171 still waiting. Have refreshed and done all these things.
I got mine in 171
You can only get it on one server.  If you already got it on another server, you will not get it on 171.  Is that what happened?
I got mine in all 3servers
I am only on one server. I will refresh and check again
Yiu get it for every server you already have an account on
I am 1 for 3 atm
Nothing yet
I only got it on my main server.  I will check some others that I already have joined.
You get it for every server regardless. Started a new world today and got the 300
I started new on 171 and didn't get it.  I also didn't get it on servers where my level was less than 5.
Idk. All I know is new account got 300 mith so I'm cool with that lol
If you created the account before 0:00 utc and are above a certain level, you get it.
29 server I got 300 mitrhill each
Not account but you know what I mean
sorry been busy. im guessing 144/236 still broken?
Yes and 169, 171, 174, 175 and 176 without 300 mith pop up
is that confirmed from multiple people?
Yep.. gcs are hopping mad
Yes loads are complaining
I didn't get it on 176 but did my others
but did my others?
His other servers
Yes, all other servers I tried I got it
ah ok
No. I created the account AFTER 00:00 and got it
Got it right after finishing tutorial
on?
177 I think it was. Not in game atm
177 does have it
And yeah you can start in a server right now and get it
That's all I was pointing out. One person was saying it had to be based on this and that and was just pointing out it didn't
You could literally start a new world right now and get 300 mith
Yep
Unless its the 5 above ....
I started new on 171, 177 and 265 just now and didn't get it on any of them after the tutorial.
Refresh
169-176 should now have compensation
Thanx, moshe
So you get 300 mith 2 worlds on 1 acc..got in both :)
on 127 people don't receive it
Thanks Moshe every world working now
Yes Moshe 144 still down
will see to get it added to 127
should be added now to 127
thanks :)
I got it on 9 of 10.  Didn't get it on 201.  3 of them were new worlds and had to refresh to get it
Anybody on 201?
We had it on 201
Ok, I tried 201 3 times and didn't get it.  My presence there must be messed up.
Check your inventory. Had a few in mine find it there without pop up
Thanks.  It went to my inventory on 201 without the pop up
Np
Ok, the only issue is really a non-issue.  I get this on all servers

I'm just glad it IS a quiet day Rose! Spamming able to read through for a change
Games very quiet atm! Guessing everyone waiting for something to mith out on?
Lol not touching mine it will sit in items
Haha same Fee
But i quite sure gaea will have something to tempt players to spend them on lol
May as well promote to other allis on our servers though
Spend!!!!!!!!!
I still have nearly 10k from weeks ago wen i won it in the anvil chests lol
Im hoarding it lol
No comment!........ except...... damn you .....lol
My spam for the day!
Lmao sorry lol
Spend some at least. An extra elite boss hit perhaps?
I did that alix lol
Wow no events ? Nothing ?
Maybe since christian hasnt done any events ,he might of been working on magus prizes ? Lol, can only hope ..
Hi guys... I apologise in advance for the length of my next post - for FS to forward to Gaea
3 Top Priorities for Gaea:
s Survey 


ers into one and allow new arrivals to enter the new server immediately.

ivise competition between players,  PvP and AvA battles.

izes should be the same as on all servers.

hed and more manageable community and a server that is more welcoming to new arrivals.

 wheel / collection / pay-to-play solo events in favour of alliance events, while adding classic tournaments between Seasons.

eturn to the traditional war strategy tournament formats: construction, troop kill, might, campaign high score and boss kill for low-mid level players, maintaining elite campaign for VIPs and experts. 

y and a 50/50 ratio of alliance vs. single events.

levels of experience will be encouraged to play and return to the game daily, even between seasons.

ms by creating exchanges for then in Sages Tower, and update  the shops with items that are more significant. 

 large numbers of useless items and placeholders accumulated from past events.

age's Tower and Shop contents must be relevant for all players, and need to be rotated more often.

nterest, and clear game memory of excess item data.
Sorry I meant 207 (Garion), not 201
None of the benefits to Gaea include increased revenue
Well said
Players spend when happy
I think revenue will increase with player engagement
Yes thats right
My world is a ghost town :-(
exactly, Alix , we thought it went without saying... ;)
Not one person on ac or gc
Bit like that on our worlds too, you need to really pester to get a peep out of them ...  

e damage.
Why is it so hard to put just 1 event on ?
Our line is quiet also
If there were more character space in AC, and 10-15 previous posts remained, LINE chat would be less necessary.
True i guess
Time to work on gear gems elite maps . Strategy.. it's good to have a break from events
Yep the spinathons will be back don't worry!
Happy not to have wheels and collection events
True mushy, but 1 event would of been nice too lol
Lol ruud
Yer i am too alix
Sort through gear, test gear on elite bosses
Yer i started sorting through my gandy V gear , will prob do some work on elite too :-)
Move to a different world
Why ? Lol
144 fixed thx ;)
A full review of value for money is needed to incentivise spending. 240mith costs ¬£19.99 U.K. iTunes. Look at what 240mith typically buys you. Not much.
I've largely stopped spending since Gaea took over because vfm is not there
That's a lap dance
Now there is value
Depends where you go. üòÇ
It's more expensive on itunes too compared to Google
1600 mith on Google Play is ¬£80, itunes it is ¬£100
That is apple pricing higher
Uh.  That's huge
I sold my old android to my friend so he can use the android to purchase his mith and uses his iphone for everything else üòÇ
Yup
Is that the same in the USA?
You gotta speak to Apple about it though. Hobbit didn't do that
Probably. Android is generally slightly cheaper, but that's a huge diff, BUT something did change with apple not too long ago and they jacked prices right up
Haha no need just buy a cheap android tablet for mith purchases :p
You make your money back
No idea about the US
I know it's cheaper to buy 1600 mith in the US than the UK with exchange rates
Or it was 18 months ago not sure if prices have changed
Exchange rate sucks now
That's right, I complained and it is Apple who have priced all apps and in app purchase on equivalence between ¬£ and $
In Australia, it's $159.99  for 1600 mithril
That's ¬£97 in UK terms
which is a hell of a lot of money
It is
in whatever terms
In Canada, it's $140 I think
Yikes
Now turn 1600 mith into tokens
150?
Exactly my earlier point. Shocking vfm
I made the point a couple of weeks ago and it's probably been brought up before but like Moshe said yesterday, nobody listens to them
I wrote to CS to complain that they were asking 10,000 mithril for one Gandalf token, and to ask if they made a mistake adding an extra zero ... CS response was that it is a rare item of course it's expensive ... üò≥
The mith rate needs to be increased because in game mith wins have devalued it.
I think it's that high so nobody does buy it
Mith to real currency rate. I'm having deja vu
yup. 1 mithril roughly equates to 1 dollar for us.
Uhhhh
16 mith equates to 1 dollar
So it costs you $1600 for 1600 mith? Lol
Shit. We need to be best friends if you're throwin that kinda money around
$100 for 100 mith
sorry missed a zero
$1 roughly equals 1token was meant, I think
I stand corrected lol
1 mithril = 10 cents
1.6 mith = 10 cents
Gtg need to get back to earning ¬£ to buy fake mith and hide it from my wife
1600 mithril = 160 dollars
Oh you're Australia
That's because your dollar is weak AF
yes
Cup of coffee at Maccas = $4.50
To me, any game asks me to spend more than $30 at a time is asking for trouble
How much is 1600 mith in USD?
Remove all world mith / tokens
Shitload of complains.^
you guys were saying 1600 mithril = $80 google play  and $100 itunes
This is complain tank I thought
Lol
Go complaint to apple not here for difference from google
Actually I would suggest not complain, smaller package deals and a Mithril mine
Yeah lets advantage autominers again...
Quiet Complain Tank
what's an auto miner?
Not the room for to tell. Lol
It's a ToS violation
1600 mith is 100 USD, still a big ripoff
Yep
Lol always
You won't change the current value so 0 point discussing.
Even if gaea and the community came to a mutual agreement, both Apple and Google would Fk it up
If you live in USA . It's 80-90 really . All you have to do is go buy a gift card . Gaea still gets 100 but you pay 10-20 less
Beat the system :)
And do you really expect gaea to go to apple and say we totally screwed our game economy can you adjust your pricing?
Paying $50 for 1600 would still be way too much
Auto miners or bot mining became pointless when gala tokens became worthless.
Beo Apple and Google would have nothing to do with it
They just have to add more mith into the price
Not adjust the price
It's 100% on the gaea side, keep the same price tiers and just adjust the amount of mith given
If they have nothing to do with it why does price vary?
if they made buy one get one or buy one get two deals frequently they would see purchases increase and not need to deal with apple/google
Nah storm that's wrong
They should double the amount of mith you get per dollar, if not more.
Apple and google have a big part with it
They do with setting up pricing per region
moshe... they have the means to give bogo....
Changing mith base amounts or prices is a legal process and has to be done through Apple
$100 should get you 3200-5000 mith
that's why they do bogo, because it's just a bonus chest .'on their side they can do that , but change the actual box that's a diff thing
Go from all bogo to bog2
Ah fuck Apple
agree pickles
Google lets you do that kind of stuff no problem, no paperwork
if they want more revenue they need to give better value. period
We just changed prices of in app purchases on an app I work on for work and there was no approval or nonsense necessary on the Google side
but we've been saying that for months.... falling on deaf ears
beg yours... what is bogo now?
buy one get one
Yup this idea was brought up back in Christian room days.
Moshe has it been brought up with Gaea?
Actually it's been mentioned way way way back
ooohhh  üòÖ  thanks Togg
Especially the cross region in prices
so to date the best they have given was buy 1600, get 1600 world mith.  not far enough or often enough imo
np cer
Variation*
They once did buy 1600 get 2k
Ok , if you can't change the 1600 = $100  then just make chests cheaper
^
Region variation makes sense though
Revalue everything
Or keep the bogo offer up all the time
or that, yes
It's a game with the same products via digital code. There is zero reason why one should get it cheaper
The bogo pops up for me regularly.
making chests cheaper doesn't really address the fact that some nonspenders can still heavily outspend anyone willing to shell out a buck
real currency should give an advantage
There are no transport, admin, tax etc costs to include which would validate variable pricing structures
Beo, gaea deserves the same amount of profit from every purchase, whether it's in Australia or US
not true beo... taxes do come into play
There's exchange rates and taxes, both of which would impact region pricing
different countries tax app store purchases at diff rates
In one country due to exchange rates the cost of 1600 mith is less than $20.
Ok and explain between Google and Apple differences
Same country ¬£20 cheaper with Google
Easy
Apple sucks and hates developers
Their dev license costs more, and they take a bigger chunk of app store profits
Well to reverse it back at you gaea sucks and doesn't care :-)
If they did they would control their economy
Ban players botting and it's really not hard to find them, not give away 10k mith tokens etc .....
Google and Apple both take the same cut off of purchases Storm
I think Apple offers incentives to apps that offer subscription based purchases though
Apple doesn't offer subscription cost break until after a full year though whereas Google starts it immediately
I know it's been said a lot but really we need to find ways to improve the game within the current limits it offers. Yes we all want new and improved events but unless something changes that's not going to happen.
Yep, that sounds right. 15% or something
that would be nice^. gaea should consider offering a monthly subscription deal.  more mith for the money but ya gotta login and collect it daily
Non subscription is 70/30, subscription is 85/15
The thing to improve is making the gap between players smaller
Reason behind my suggesting the gear for titanium charms was at least we could run some enhance events. Followed by upgrade which is now viable with the beginner chests dropping upgrade items.
Without giving free stuff ofc
Developers make twice as much in subscription model, but Apple won't let you switch until a user's subscription has been active a while year
Yes they ae boring but so is spinning a wheel constantly
Agreed Dutch
But that requires either removing economic strategy from the game, or waiting for those that have zero self control for wheels / events to quit
Way to remove gap is give the lower ranked teams better prizes than the higher ranked ones.
Yeah lets make a ton 1man alliances
And Gaea can do this easily as prizes are not announced until final days of a season.
Easy to fix. Only pay top 10 allies
That will ruin the competition
Not gonna happen
lol let's punish the most competitive for being the most competitive.
If you want to close the gap that is the quickest way to do it.
But not the fairest
We dont want the quickest way. We want the best way
Only people who are getting screwed are the ones most commutes so they will be the least likely to quit.
Committed*
Yup...till the bitter end!
In a dying game the quickest is the best.
Or more likely
Hardly the most committed lol
Eventually people are deciding it's just not worth he effort and quitting.
The most committed are the ones setting alarms through the night to compete in all season events
Been that way since the first merge
Your telling me that the #2 team on any server is more committed than the #1 team?
Only way to create a balance is to cap how much you can use on any given wheel/event
And I don't mean 100k like Tower passes
Good idea smash
Yeah caps are a good way to limit economy
It will slow down...but they would need to up tokens given out again for that to work
I agree on the cap but then the spenders quit unfortunately if they quit the game becomes obsolete fast
That would create a different problem though
You could take it a step further and have an staggered cap on members per alliance
No balance... the force doesn't need to be balanced... the game just needs to work properly... pay out alliance prizes immediately(no waiting) ... offer what is intended to be paid...(at the end of the event) and no more ooops...sorry we've gotta shut the whole thing down cause something exploded
The more members the less you can use
If the top players can't use their inventory, all hell will break loose
That might actually be enough for regents to remove inactives
We can't use inventories now storm.
Last few wheels...perfect example
They could have done a inter allience glory rank the higher you are per allience the more you can use tokens stams etc
Jesus...don't add more to their plate... let them sort the chaos they've already created...
Pipe dreams snow
Half pipe on an oakenshield V
Some of these are great ideas, but we have to assume the most Gaea will do is change a limit or add zero. They are not going to add new dimensions to the game that would require too much developer work.
An alliance tier system would be awesome. Effort in events rewarded with higher rank maybe and bonuses. As a regent it would be awesome you could see who is doing stuff. But ya. Think that's a dream to be able to implement at this point.
Right now you can't tell what anyone is doing. No reason to train or tk so any in game stats tell you nothing.
+1 to toggs subscription idea. Even though I can already hear the accompanying whines about what you get.
Elven wine and demounts
So how about tourney tokens for t tokens... aren't a lot of little guys holding them as well? Not many people are sitting on 5 k plus tourney tokens and at 1:1 trade 5k t tokens are good for what maybe 2 wheels
Not sure how far im off that dan but it's not too far lol
How about they take a week off sort their sh¬•te, pay out all the tardy prizes... stop offering to sell us death sticks and go home to rethink their lives.
Merge ?
Lol, if the top alliances were really dedicated to getting the game active...  they would tell the lower alliances of the server when to hold and when to spin to grow accounts. Not every wheel but 1 or 2 just to catch them up a bit
But that's 90% of the game now
It's an inventory building strategy game
Dan that won't catch them up. They don't have the inventory to keep pace.
Outside of ECHS, every event comes down to what you have in the bag and how much you're willing to use
Sure they do everyone has thousands remember pickles
Even Echs is turned in to that with season stamina caps
Schs is the only true skill event left
True
Maybe a TaT but those are rare af now too
Rare, and while I'll admit there's skill, it's more so a competition of who has the most free time and a good Internet connection
That's always been the case for most events
group message
Chs events were always the exception to that though, until stamina caps
Good morning...is this happening to anyone this am
Not i
Or I
Try quit and reopen instead of restart, usually more effective for me
Item Ideas...

d gems...Make Legolas a legendary hero.  

ncrease march 500-1000% for an hour.
Try the flange flux capacitor thingemy Bob
And the rest of the skill 3
Nah I meant like once they get the tokens through tourny token trade or something. Then teach them how to build there account like the rest of us did. Sat and held forever waiting for 1 glitches wheel. Even if it meant being inactive for 6 months
Make gap smaller?  How much tokens top ally get per month, how much smaller players get.  Who wins all good prize tourneys?  Ppl ask for more hw ally events, which just simply give top ally more boost on gap
Most alliances that are lower ranked have less active players. So good wheels will still widen the gap.
Exactly ziduo
Which is why I mentioned capping on a member number basis.
The gap will never be fixed. The top alliances will always win more for less while the lower allies get less for more.
I agree it would still widen the gap, but wouldn't widen it as much. That's also part of the reason I suggested it. Top alliance will still stay on top. Not saying anyone has to do any of it. I'm just mentioning ways to help shorten the gap and boost activity if we are truly desperate for actives. But anyone with a brian can see that we aren't
Make more season long servers, game reset every three months
Every time a season long server(s) starts, player can choose bring up to 5k or 10k world mith over from home world
"I agree it would still widen the gap,..." "I'm just mentioning ways to help shorten the gap..." those statements seem at odds Dan.
250 was fun
ted
d and play
el,  you know everything you hoard will become junk
250 was fun.
Current old worlds just so polluted,  gaea/kabam had tried ways, include merge. All short term, then side effect comes
Pickles you didn't read the statement after. It would continue to widen the gap, but not at the rate it's doing now. I really worded it
Re*
250 does not all the fancy gems, runes,  towers, different wheels, still fun.  We have all kinds of stuff, all added extra just making game more unbalanced
I'm just letting the game run its point at this point
I think game was screwed trying to close gap of spender and non spender with intro of tokens to Smaug and game has never recovered since
That was entirely down to a separate issue though eel
On a more real issue hope anyone living in Sweden is safe and well.
What happened in Sweden ?
Same thing as London

It's going to get worse too with the idiot we have running the country(US). Hope everyone as well as family and friends are and stay safe
Game issues mean nothing compared to that crap.
was 144/236 fixed ever? btw
Thought I saw someone say 144 was up again
kool
group message
Yes, 236 is back to normal too
Good afternoon, last news about magus?
It'll never be paid out
Sure?
I was scoffed at when I said 16 business days... but, I think we are well past that now.
IDK, most important thing is Gaea pay the magus... Before next season if it's possible
I'm gonna say it again... ALLIANCE PRIZES SHOULD BE PAID OUT AS SOON AS PURCHASED/WON.... no waiting, no worrying about who's in and out of the alliance... if I buy it.. GIVE IT!
Someone's impatient
It is ridiculous
Should have queried 1/2 way thru
Dude... after 4-5 years of this nonsense... "oh sorry we lost track...can you prove to us that you bought it...?"
Absolutely ridiculous
Hopefully by not running wheels they will have a chance to catch up on prizes owning
Today is the 10th day.
Someone in my ally bought the mith for ally gem4 too...wonder if we will see those Anytime either
We'll work week is over so not happening over weekend
Sorry... being a pessimist... not really a bad day just feel like bitching about outstanding issues here and in game today.
Gem 4 already paid?
John: we bought 3 of the alliance gem3(art) way back and only got 2 of them.
work week is not over for Gaea ... but I still don't think that Magus will be paid out before next week, lol
After providing lots of info... we still only got the 2
They should quit with any form of manual payout
Since they never can pay out in time
I'm sure they would if they could, Dutch
You would think it obvious by now, but sadly they keep doing it
But for example if you buy a mount in crownshop you get it immediatly
there aren't any elite mounts in crownshop
As an example.;)
 and like all boxes you get instantly your payout
And yes they havent coded it yet so why dont they have still after 4 months?
That's the point exactly: they aren't in the box, they need to be paid out manually
I guess because devs are coding something else?
Probaly. Other priorities.:(
ya :/
Stop ally gifts
Problem solved
They should wait to release then, until it's properly built. Same with other rollouts that are half baked and untested.
No it won't. That will cost $
Can't handle it, don't do it
Individual manual payout makes not much sense
It would save time and a ton tickets
Not untested, just as we are testers
Magus will probably be paid out Tuesday
That's just a FS guess
Or at least some of it
So take next friday lol
Immediately!
Nah we are pretty good with our guesses Dutch lol
Knowing christian and Gaea
You never know with GAEA.:p
There won't we any immediate Magus payouts, lmao
Ty moshe
Sorry still being a bitch...lol... you guys do great work...so don't ever think my complaining is about your efforts!
Collection for the weekend? Again?
group message
Oh my
Just posted on hobbit fb page
They hired me
Gifts are gifts I didn't trade thinking it would show up swiftly. Better than no alli gift event which is how allies help each other get stuff.
Lots of people don't even get gems to drop for them until it's gifted.
Especially as the gifts are individually queried, it will take awhile
Requirement number 2 will eliminate a lot of ppl in this room.  Lol
And as far as mith purchase there was another one since the last payout that had random defensive gem gift
That hasn't been paid yet
I think someone of the FS or similars must talk about magus and give us a solution or a date
group message
Dates seem meaningless to me they always change
group message
Was up there
Even with Christian, he always small print everything subject to change.
So just take the closest guess
Thx
Still got an Easter season to do yet
Like I said that probably is from FS not gaea
So don't come in here saying why hasn't magus been paid out Gaea said Tuesday . When Gaea didn't say it lol
That's called a disclaimer lol
Clever :)
I told you, 4 weeks
Meh, if nothing worth spending on is around, then doesn't really matter when we get them
lol I said 1-10 days . Tuesday happens to be 10th day
can we get a wheel... weird not having one
Nothing takes 4 weeks
For manual payouts . Let's be realistic :)
They were busy with the server problems
We all know that
Give it an hour cat. Weekend is here. Another collection should be coming
Last couple days that is
@„Äëƒê‚Çµ„Äê  there will probably.be one in 1 hour 15
hope so John, also hope i won't be too drunk to spin by then
Lol. Hopefully I will be and save tokens lol
There is no such thing as too drunk
also lol John, ur the only one callin me cat here
fair point
You'll always be (cat)
*insert drunk cat sticker
You knew who I was talking to ;)
obvs ;)
Why is there thorins mini masters in shop? Did they forget the wheel ? lol
Least it wont be a mith wheel by looks lol
Wheel will be up in 3
Ohh after legolas finishes ?
patience, good players (tearsofjoy)
Im not impatient ,lol i was just wondering lolol
If we are a shit player can we be impatient
Lmao
WHEEL! fk yeah
Are you mac?(hehe)
nope, shit players just accept, lol
Indeed dutch and damned either way lol
Events too, lol
I'm bored of this chat for now 
e
Tom :|
group message
Yes. Only key lol
Oh glad it's not just mine
same for me, but fuck it let's play
Looks like they are finally giving us something worthy of a thorin token.
apology accepted HH tho i wasn't thete
Why is wheel blank lol
Lol i wouldn't spin it swallows tokens and pays out no chests
Latest tactic in token drain?
Russian Roulette ... I bet Moshe came up with it
No the chests arent going into items ?
lmao
no
giggity
no boxes to inventory
Dud wheel lol
Moshpie ;)
I'm still gonna play
oh nvm think something got changed or wheel taken down
Chests not appearing in my inventory
Vaults equal we can't see or open
Not me
Like me Phoenician
i started gettin an error now that i tried again
Plat is all tokens gone. (hehe)
someone's been informed
Im doing refresh
yea its taken down
Cat are you drinking? ;)
obviously I'm drinking but i still wanna spin
I get nothing on refresh. Blank screen. 263
group message
The wheels gone
Hopefully getting fixed
Now after 4 resets. Game. No wheel.
pls i need a wheel meow
TOM is better
Lol kitty :)
Yeah pop all you have for TOM. Prizes are good
lol Dutch I already did ;)
Why not, highly demanded event
there's a tom?
Yes. Go go go
Yes, with T tokens for rewards, lmao
Love those tournament chests
What else prize expect
Im not doing to much just for tourney tokens lol
oooh i definitely need more t tokies. i have too few thousands
to use on absolutely nothing
How do people have gps? The mith deal?
Well i was enjoying a thorins wheel while it lasted lol was good to finally see one ,,short lived lol
It is all the prize for it.  Wheel events gives wheel chests, tourney events give tourney tokens, weekend collection events gives collection prizes
mith deals or marvels I'd guess.
tauriels masters should update the gp to any wheel
Thought ppl should be happy for non wheel events
Not sure dc, i got 3 keys in not to many spins so wouldnt of been hard to get a gp
Attitudes like that is why we are continually screwed over
just to make it clear i don't want compensation for the tokies i wasted on thorins wheel
Yes non wheel event but the prizes are worthless
Something is facts
A wheel once in a while is good esp a thorins since we havent had one for awhile,
Just lower expections
Put them in a weekend event and it has some worth
Yer not everyday
Even in a season it sucks
Yer shouldnt be in season
I have no expectations from this game anymore
shhh i like wheels. only effortless "comps"
It is flash events, each event is a prize
No everything seems to be crashing also  woody
Mini series is great, but with issues itself
But nothing to cash in on
Chests have been took out the shop too
flash = get 3 of the required item and you rank if its hw
When was the last tourney token range?
In a season i recall,  i did not shoot because nothing useful
Even though they suck you are basically playing for no prize
I liked the last mini series it was ok.
2 seasons ago yes
Yer dayle they have
Not really playing for prize anymore for a long time
i liked the magus sht but apparently it's not givin sht for my mates that play way more than me
I'm a lazy tard
Can't even get a wheel right
Year of 2017 is pay no expectation to prize, any prize
Yeah but why add might for this tom is my point
GAEA cant afford too much alli gifts events. Altho it drains alot tokens, it gives alot tokens and (rare) items back
Because players asking for it
You're saying it's a non spin event but it's pointless
It's a tat :)
Players asked for it to be linked to a collection event or mini series
Also...will we all get banned for tying in this gold collection?
Lol minas
I didnt get one i tried though
I am a strong supporter of mini series
Nah you will place based on player ID. Hehe
a question about the gold collection. will they pay out prizes if the wheel doesn't really exist,
?
I enjoyed the last one zid
Yes you'll get a load of empty boxes
If they do not pull it from event center u might get prize
I am too
Probably lol they'll be empty tho
Theres a few people on the board also for gp event
Bought the mith deal fee. Most likely
my server has 4 lol
some may have spinned i oops msgd on gc that there was a wheel so guess it counted "landing on gold" while the box itself didn't register
Ysr true minas possibly
Any news from Magus
Abracadabra
nope
Harry Potter?
but i think wheel will be up again soon
the boxes showed up in inventory
wheel will be up soon yes
Yeah icons are normal for gold collect
Moshe is playing with us
Just hope GAEA doesnt decrease gold droprate. (hmm)
Hh said wheelwill be back asap
lol
Lol
who owns HH?
Moshe
Evenstar
Owns HH
Someone with a good sence humor lol
ahh oky thanks. was just wondering.  been too used to twitch bots
Np cat
even sent out that message :)
Germans...  Always so serious..... :p
TOMs with reward season tokens?? That's aprils fun tourney
Yup them tokens are useless
Prizes from wheel are now in my items
Tourney token range ~ Lego range. Not really useless if a range is up
Yer im doing minimal in the toms
Prob is tourney token range hasn't been on for a month
people asked for regular comps :P now they are up
now people dont want to play regular comps
It was supposed to be on basically all the time
Don't think for tournament tokens which are useless
Moshe that's not funny
well i said it would happen lol.
not that i agree with prizes lol.
It's opposite of what people are asking
Radagast gear
group message
Non collection tourneys with normal prizes not goof season tokens
Love it they fill all gp with attack or life runes lol
They would be ok if were decent trades for them in sage ,put some wind n decay in ,,lol
Yer we get enough of them now lol
I get the random all in one events to stress test servers, but TOM?
Do a tk
Or CHS as was previous
No TOM is worth Season tokens as reward
With those i mainly  got the life or attk runes not the rare gem
wind n decay aren't important. most have a bunch still
Yer they are to some dc
We had discussion in here other day bout them alot players would like trades for them
Ty hh
Axiom is a hypocrite
Lol, I found a hidden command
Boot him
Lol
What did I say?!
You wrote for gear in this chat when you always tell people to go pm
Hush
(hahaha)(hahaha)(hahaha)
Oh yeah, this is the first wheel for rada, right?
The gold chest drop rate sucks lol
they usually seem to drop the rate of "required" box
10-15% is normal
More keys than gold chests lol
lol someone said they were dropping like crazy before it stopped
And now guess what haha
Lol yeps
There are a ton of hidden commands xd
Can they just put a portable up lol
Lol
On the last day they will
Gollum coins going to be back in April?
Meh let's just wait till may , like we did with February (hahaha)
Lol, fair enough
it's a shit wheel tbh
Its great
Spin all coins and make gaea happy
group message
ya call that great?
Amazing
Yep thats what i get lo
I'll probably dump 20k tokens on it
Lol
Thats why gps are so easy to get now i suppose
No wonder everyone is quiting the game won a elite mount two weeks ago still nothing went threw same crap on my main server too
I havent won one tg lol
Tourney tokens better than go
Gp*
How many life runes do they think we need
Don't do any good to win when they never pay out
Lol eel n yeps dayle i agree
True deeds
3/4 of my alliance is about to quit over this kinda crap getting tired of begging players to keep playing gaea needs to help us give them a reason to stay
i have an elite mount but not really feeling the game anymore
Takes 7 days to upgrade the mount
Yeah getting the same way
Yes alot are quitting unfortunately :-(
And don't have a reason to use it
No i upgraded my elite on my main servers same day
Does gold chest drop rate increase with level 20 mount?
.?
actually took me 30 mins to upgrade mine but hell this shit ain't worth 30 minutes
I gave up and started feeding it. Then got lazy and stopped doing that as well
Game having loading issues all the time any more never get rewards when we should are they trying to kill the game if they are they are succeeded
Succeeding*
I'd just say the time it takes to up an elite mount is sad. 30mins with all 10k exps. can't imagine with less than that or feeding
Gaea needs to put some of the money they are making back into the game like common sense would tell you or just give us a end day end the game
We all keep hoping for some miracle change that will never happen cause gaea doesn't give a to sense
i haven't been hoping for anything since last summer
XW alli tom.  Why not have a home world alli Tom instead of individual Tom.  SMH
FS did ask for HW ally, no idea why Gaea aren't doing them. We will continue asking for them
Because xworld alli TOM drains more might.lol
Thank you evenstar
I think it gaea was trying to say... here big players, spin your buts off. Little guys pop your might
Would def be nice to have at least some hw ally events
I think most would be even happy with HW gold collect lol
Doesnt have to be tom. Just anything  lol
Lol yeps stefan
Agreed, hw events are nice. Just it's harder for the little guys to compete again
Yes for sure
make it bronze.  my gold luck is always the min
Lol, fee. No idea but yes. 

lked to Christian what's up with whoever runs the game, lol
Cant be as bad as mine, 2 gold chests in 100 spins :-(
There is a lot of individual home world Tom. This weekend it looks like
Yer stefan can hope so, but who knows lol
True fair im doing minimal in them
I am doing the same.
Cool
It's a complex game to be run by one person albeit capable, one can do this much long term and expect results
Thats right
It sucks the life out of all the  little guys that want to compete. When they do XW
I dont do xw
If i win anything by chance thats a bonus lol
You care about little guy again . Thought you were all complaining about tom and tourney tokens . That is a Comp for little guy and you were all complaining before
Lol
I swear the most overused word little guy is just code for I want certain things
Im not that little
Thorin tokens are flooded anyway.  And look bright, mith in gold silver and bronze
So not me lol
True zid it is good to see a thorins wheel tbh lol
I am not that little either
Lol
But the smaller alliances can't really compete and get prizes unless it's home world comps
Plus it may help bring back good trades if the little guys can catch up to us in tourney token count
They can compete by placing in Indy tourneys . Build up inventory . They will always have less than bigger alliances . Your argument is not about little guy . Its about a competition type you enjoy
How do you figure?
What can I do to get HobbitHelper to shut up?
goodbye
Shh moshe... once it's on its on forever bud
Say goodbye mylo
Lol
Thanks Moshe and Fee lol Dan
I was afraid about that though Dan..
Yw
Anyway not game related sorry but thanks all!
Lol  its cool :P
Someone in another xworld chat just posted this...

is this a force refresh or a reinstall issue or something else?
I think a bad connection
Wifi connection can be a fickle thing
Run Helen...your eyes may bleed trying to read junk here (haha)
Gaea can't do anything right
Sure they can
What they can't do is anything that will make the majority of people here happy
Welcome back Helen
They arr great at doing nothing right.

group message
Can anyone explain how I have 800m and haven't opened anything?
No gear upgrades either
You are good!
Mounts?
Cheater üòÇ
Op3n any boxes with gems?
GPs
Gems have might
Just opening them?
Yep.. from what i understand
Since you are adding them to your open inventory
That would explain my 5b MG last week lol thanks
Gonna test that on the next batch I open
Gens gear uogrades they all count
You cheat that's the reason
üòä
They got those gem 6s, screwed up the tom, i want compensation (rofl)
They didn't make their end of the week deadline on the citrine 6s this week either
they removed a bunch lol.
guess not all
Yeah most of em seem to be gone
I want 18 elite tarpans 20 elite boars and 50k mith
38 elite? U r gonna upgrade them?
Dunno what the hell kinda scripts they run, but it's kinda crazy that removing a single unique item is so difficult for them
What log they have
Thats 300 mith with nornal bank interest compounded lol
They may keep having error time out
Skip players
Error timeout is only a thing when connecting to the servers externally
Maybe a poor cursor, doing try catch 1 million times, walk through all accounts
Christian is using external tool i think
Just an admin version of game client
Ouch
Do not believe he has direct access to database
its super easy to remove if its in inventory.. it takes a few minutes
Command line access or bust
the harder part is when peole equip it to gear, so they have to go 1 person at a time
Poor cursor like
so technically.. while he could be spending time on something else, they have to spend their hours removing those gems from those people trying to hide them ;)
That still should be doable with a single line of code in 99% of coding environments, shame he can't get an extra dev to help out
Too many instances of correcting it, dev probably do not want to get into the mess
I hope their database layer can not be directly accessed by a tool.  They are controlled and behind api.  Not letting hackers to play with their data.
How do you hide a gem?
In a deep mountain
Stick it someplace uncomfortable
I still have temp gear. But I only stuck it on a Bilbo.
API is only another layer of abstraction, ultimately if you can hack and their security is as lax as we can safely assume it is based on incompetence, then it doesn't really matter
Just imagine Christopher Walken and where he put his gold watch
how do you think that russian guy had 5000 wheel masters?
he had to have given himself 5000 wheel masters through the backend
It in his name
It's*
Lol shhh
5000 wheel masters must have been won legit.  Or bought.  Right. No ones that stupid to hack that crazy amount.  ..... right? That would be too obvious.
How would you buy 5k wm?
It's only obvious if Gaea cares.
Is it 100 at a time max?
That's 3m mith
It's usually 20 or 40
Haha. Dam 125 deals in a row maxed. Haha
Or maybe his alliance did an alliance spend 2500 times
Happens all the time lol
Even better.
Maybe the point was to make it obvious....
If you hack system and get caught just start another account eventually one hacked account will slip by Gaea's impenetrable wall.
Does it really matter
Nothing really matters
Is the game Down again
